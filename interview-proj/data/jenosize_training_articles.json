Connecting Brands with CustomersArtMarketingBusinessADBy:Jenosize.com90What Is Event Marketing? Building Brands Through Experience In today s digital era, consumer choices are abundant, and attention spans are short. Creating tangible, memorable experiences has become a critical strategy for brands to stand out. Event marketing is one such powerful tool enabling brands to showcase their products, services, or values through interactive events. These can take place both offline and online, helping to foster brand recognition, emotional engagement, and long-term loyalty with target audiences. What Is Event Marketing?Event marketing is the strategic process of planning, managing, and communicating a brand through specifically designed events. The goal is to build brand awareness, strengthen customer engagement, and drive purchase decisions. Ultimately, event marketing aims to develop long-term relationships with customers.What does event marketing involve? It depends on the brand s objective. Examples include:Product launchesTrade showsWorkshops or seminarsExperiential eventsBooth participation at expos or festivalsSocial media campaigns and competitionsWhy Is Event Marketing Important?Traditional advertising is no longer enough to capture consumer interest. Today s businesses need to create experiences that resonate. The importance of event marketing lies in its ability to:Differentiate your brand in saturated markets. A well-executed event can make a brand memorable and build a distinctive image.Drive engagement and emotional connection. Thoughtfully designed events allow customers to feel part of the brand experience.Gather valuable audience insights. From registrations and surveys to behavioral tracking, events provide actionable data on target groups.Enable real-time sales opportunities. Events not only encourage purchases during the event but also allow sales teams to engage directly with qualified prospects.Build brand credibility. Professionally run events elevate brand perception and build trust with both new and existing audiences.Types of Event Marketing for Modern BusinessesModern event marketing is far more than just trade booths and corporate functions. Businesses today can align their events with consumer behavior and current technologies in several ways:Brand ActivationThese are public activities designed to raise awareness and form emotional bonds with the brand. For example, offering product sampling in a shopping mall or hosting an outdoor experience that encourages social media sharing. One of notable event marketing examples is a coffee brand s Brew in the Park event, where customers tasted fresh brews and learned the process hands-on. Hybrid EventsThis approach combines offline and online elements, allowing brands to reach a wider audience. For example, a hotel seminar can be livestreamed on Zoom or Facebook Live, with real-time Q&A from online attendees. This type of event marketing removes geographic limits and provides measurable digital data. Experience MarketingFocused on immersive activities, experience marketing helps participants connect meaningfully with the brand. Examples include product demonstrations set in real-life environments or booths designed with specific themes, like a Japanese cooking station hosted by a condiment brand. These experiences create lasting brand impressions.Event Marketing Examples: Case Studies from Successful CampaignsWhen done strategically, event marketing activities can drive tangible results and foster nationwide brand affinity. Below are two government-led examples that highlight success in both sales and brand communication:Offline 2 Online ExpoOne of outstanding event marketing examples is the Offline 2 Online Expo by Thailand s Department of Business Development. The expo promoted local products nationwide through a series of trade fairs held across five major regions, covering over 2,000 square meters of event space.Jenosize, the agency responsible for event planning and execution over nine months, applied a blended event marketing strategy merging on-ground activation with digital engagement.Results:This cross-platform strategy attracted thousands from diverse regions, boosting total spending from the initial THB 30 million target to over THB 80 million. The event also showcased the potential of event marketing to uplift local economies and drive real-time sales.Ministry of Science Innovation ShowcaseAnother case highlights the use of event marketing to amplify innovation. The Ministry of Science organized an outdoor event in downtown Bangkok to showcase over 100 tech-enhanced products, many requiring live demonstrations to illustrate real-world benefits.Results:With Jenosize overseeing event space planning, products like fruit-harvesting tools and agricultural devices had ample room for hands-on interaction. Visitors experienced the products firsthand, improving public perception of Thai innovations and encouraging future business expansion.Key Considerations for Effective Event MarketingWhile event marketing is a powerful way to create memorable experiences and strong connections, poor execution or overlooked details can hinder success. The following best practices ensure your event marketing activities align with your business goals:1. Set Clear ObjectivesDefine a specific goal whether launching a product, increasing short-term sales, or raising brand awareness. Clear objectives help guide event structure, messaging, and performance tracking. 2. Choose the Right Venue and TimingThe venue should match the audience s convenience and the event s purpose. For instance, a product launch may work best in a bustling retail space, while academic sessions fit better in conference halls. Plan early to allow sufficient preparation. 3. Promote Your Event WidelyDon t underestimate pre-event promotion. Use social media, email marketing, online campaigns, or even on-site ads to attract quality attendees and boost participation. 4. Collect Data and Measure SuccessTrack attendees, engagement levels, and feedback to assess your event's impact. Use these insights to optimize future event marketing strategies, such as adjusting formats or enhancing specific touchpoints. 5. Prepare for the UnexpectedEvents are prone to surprises bad weather, technical glitches, or unexpected crowd sizes. Always have a backup plan and a team trained to adapt swiftly to maintain a high-quality experience.Event marketing is more than organizing an event it s a strategic communication tool that builds sustainable brand value. It allows companies to deliver their value proposition directly to the audience in an impactful, human-centric way. In a world where people value meaningful experiences over promotional messaging, a well-planned event marketing strategy can set your brand apart and drive long-term success.If your organization is seeking a trusted partner to design and manage events that truly connect with your target audience, Jenosize offers end-to-end event marketing services tailored to your brand s goals.

    "content": "9 Experiential Marketing Trends to Watch in 2030HomeIndustrySolutionProductWorkIdeasPeopleCareerAboutContact UsLanguage: enthHomeIndustry Solution Product WorkIdeasPeopleCareerAboutContact Usenth Back9 Experiential Marketing Trends to Watch in 2030TechnologyMarketingBusinessADBy:Jenosize.com609 Experiential Marketing Trends 2030 Businesses Must KnowCustomer experience is no longer just about providing good service. It has become the cornerstone of marketing strategy across all sectors whether in SMEs, retail businesses, or government organizations. But have you ever wondered how experiential marketing trends in 2030 will evolve? With cutting-edge technology as a key driver and consumers expecting more complex, higher standards from brands, the landscape is set for a dramatic shift.9 Experiential Marketing Trends 2030: What Consumers Will Expect in the Future ?1. Merging the Physical and Digital Worlds (Merged Reality)Merged Reality is set to eliminate the divide between offline and online experiences. Using Mixed Reality (MR) technology, consumers will engage with brands through a hybrid of physical and digital experiences. For example, retail stores might allow customers to try on products from home using MR glasses, or government service centers could offer simulations to teach citizens how to navigate bureaucratic processes. This trend creates new touchpoints that foster a deeper connection with brands regardless of location.2. Immersive, Participatory ExperiencesExperiential marketing in 2030 will move beyond presentation and into full-on participation. Consumers won t settle for passive advertising they want to be players in the brand experience. Immersive technologies like 360 environments, multi-sensory interaction, and spatial audio will be key features in product demonstrations, events, and even government training. These experiences go beyond visuals to build meaningful, emotional connections with participants.3. AI and Automation for Personalized CommunicationAI and machine learning will become core brand ambassadors. Beyond answering questions or recommending products, these technologies will interpret customer needs, communicate naturally, and deliver hyper-relevant experiences. Think human-like chatbots, real-time virtual hosts at events, or auto-generated personalized content based on user context. Strategically implemented, AI will allow brands to offer care and precision that once seemed impossible.4. Hyper-Personalization Becomes the New StandardHyper-personalization isn t just about addressing customers by name in emails. It means deeply understanding each individual s life stage, emotions, and needs at every touchpoint. Brands will use data from multiple sources click behavior, in-store movement, even health data to create personalized experiences. For instance, sending a fitness promotion to someone who just joined a gym, or dynamically adjusting app UX to match a user s style.5. Digital Trust as the Foundation of ExperienceBy 2030, trust will no longer be optional it will be expected. Consumers will choose brands that prioritize transparency and data protection. For experiential marketing 2030, this means building on digital ethics: clear consent policies, data transparency, and secure systems. Brands that fail to deliver on this front, no matter how compelling their experiences, risk swift backlash from consumers and society.6. Loyalty Programs as Lifestyle EcosystemsLoyalty programs will evolve far beyond points and rewards. They will become ecosystems supporting long-term relationships, integrating with health services, travel, or social initiatives. Customers will enjoy benefits that align with their lifestyle like converting online shopping points into online course discounts or charitable donations. In experiential marketing trends 2030, brand loyalty will be defined by how well brands support their customers' personal goals.7. Digital-First Experiences as the Core StrategyFuture products and services will be designed with digital experience at the core not as a supplementary channel. Picture branchless banks offering fully integrated mobile apps or shopping malls with AR platforms enabling customers to browse from home. A digital-first mindset enables brands to scale efficiently, reduce costs, increase flexibility, and meet the needs of digitally native consumers.8. Omnichannel Will Become the NormConsumers will expect seamless experiences across all platforms and physical spaces. They want brands to remember and understand every interaction be it a website chat, an in-store purchase, or an event registration. A unified omnichannel approach ensures consistent messaging and functionality, increasing satisfaction and driving repeat purchases.9. Sustainability as a Core Principle in Tech DesignTechnology that performs well must also respect the planet. Experiential marketing in 2030 will spotlight sustainable practices monitoring the carbon footprint of digital campaigns, efficient use of cloud systems, energy-saving hardware choices, and low-waste events. Brands that demonstrate real environmental commitment and embed ESG principles into their experience design will earn greater consumer loyalty.Experiential marketing 2030 goes far beyond using digital tools it s about creating a new world where brands and consumers connect deeply through immersive technology, AI, trust, and sustainability. Businesses that want to thrive must begin laying this foundation today to keep pace with fast-changing consumer expectations.If your organization is ready to transition into the future of customer experience and marketing, investing in a digital transformation service that understands both technology and business context is key.

These areas frequently experience large-scale earthquakes capable of causing significant damage to life, property, and public infrastructure. In response, the Japanese government and research organizations have been actively advancing cutting-edge technology to strengthen early warning systems and reduce the devastating impacts of natural disasters. One of the most promising developments in recent years is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in earthquake preparedness specifically for prediction, analysis, and systematic response.Real-Time AI Technology for Earthquake Epicenter DetectionOne breakthrough innovation is an AI earthquake prediction system developed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). This system accurately detects the epicenter of earthquakes occurring along the Nankai Trough. Previously, location estimates could deviate by up to 20 kilometers, but the AI has reduced that margin to just a few kilometers calculating it within only five seconds.This AI earthquake prediction in Japan uses 3D seismic wave data from high-risk zones to provide real-time analysis. It enables agencies like the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue timely earthquake or tsunami warnings, significantly increasing response speed.High-precision data in the critical seconds after an earthquake strikes is crucial to minimizing loss of life and property, allowing for faster evacuations and emergency responses.AI Earthquake Preparedness Models for Soil Stability and Liquefaction RiskAnother significant development is a 3D soil analysis model created by the Shibaura Institute of Technology. This AI earthquake preparedness system uses Artificial Neural Networks and Assembled Learning to evaluate the risk of liquefaction a phenomenon where the ground turns into liquid due to seismic vibrations. This condition is a major cause of structural collapse in coastal and soft-soil areas.The model enables:Urban planners to identify safe zones for construction.Engineers to design structures suited to the soil profile of each area.Local governments to implement comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures.Strategic Business and Government Benefits of Earthquake Preparedness in JapanAI in earthquake preparedness is more than an engineering tool it also serves as a strategic asset for businesses and public sector planning:Site selection: Helps assess seismic risk before investing in office buildings or warehouses.Insurance planning: Informs premium negotiations through detailed risk analysis.Business Continuity Planning (BCP): Provides accurate data to build emergency response strategies.Urban alert systems: Minimizes social and economic disruption by enabling faster evacuation in densely populated areas.Expanding the Role of BCP in the Thai Business ContextFor Thai businesses, particularly those operating factories, energy grids, or large warehouses in risk-prone zones, having a BCP is critical. AI systems that analyze seismic history and soil composition in real time can help executives:Choose safer locations for expansion.Relocate or segment critical operations.Build more resilient supply chains.Additionally, AI simulation tools can model scenarios such as seismic vibrations or evacuation routes, allowing organizations to create actionable BCPs that reduce potential harm to people and operations during unexpected events. Opportunity for Thailand to Adapt Japan s Model Although Thailand is not located in a major seismic zone like Japan, tremors can still occur particularly in the North and West due to proximity to neighboring countries. In recent years, earthquakes have even been felt in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Sawan, and Phuket, including a notable event on March 28, 2025.Adopting learnings from AI earthquake prediction in Japan offers Thailand several benefits:Developing a domestic early warning system.Using soil data for urban planning and structural design.Enhancing business resilience against climate and natural disasters.One promising initiative could involve applying Japanese AI models in high-risk provinces like Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Tak. These areas have reported tremors from Myanmar, and collaborations between geoscience agencies, universities, and local governments could lead to 3D soil modeling and the installation of deep seismic sensors setting the foundation for a robust national disaster response system.Private-sector companies in real estate and infrastructure can also utilize this data to build safer, more sustainable projects aligned with long-term development goals.Japan s strategic use of AI to manage natural disasters especially earthquakes demonstrates how real-time, data-driven analysis can save lives and improve resilience. These technologies are not only essential for public safety but also for empowering businesses and governments to prepare for an uncertain future. If Thailand can adapt these innovations into its own national planning, the result could be a smarter, safer, and more stable society.For organizations looking to implement advanced tech solutions for businesses.

The more an event can impress attendees to the point where they feel like they don t want to leave, the clearer the signal that the brand has delivered a quality experience.This kind of success doesn t happen by chance. It s the result of intentional planning, design, and meticulous attention to every detail of the event experience anchored in what s known as a sensory experience. Here s how leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates who keep coming back for more.What Is a Sensory Experience?A sensory experience refers to a marketing approach that engages the human senses sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions. By appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments that foster deep emotional engagement and personal connection.Brands that master the art of crafting sensory experiences don t just make an impression they embed themselves in memory. It s not just about awareness; it s about emotion and attachment. This depth of connection is what fuels long-term brand loyalty and drives organic word of mouth.7 Sensory Experience Techniques for Designing Unforgettable Event Experiences1. Stimulate Sight\"Attract from the first glance with a design that reflects your brand identity.\"Visual presentation is the gateway to your brand s universe. Elements like spatial design, lighting, brand colors, logos, and stage visuals should clearly reflect the brand image. Using brand-consistent color palettes, lighting that complements the mood, and Instagram-worthy photo spots can organically boost online sharing and visibility. 2. Engage Taste\"A great taste lingers longer than any words.\"Food and beverages aren t just refreshments they re storytelling tools. Curate menus that align with your event s theme, incorporate local flavors to set the scene, or even develop signature drinks and treats that reflect your brand identity. Each bite becomes an extension of your brand narrative. 3. Evoke Memory Through Smell\"Scent is the most powerful trigger of memory.\"Scents have a surprising influence on mood and memory. Pleasant aromas throughout your event space can induce calmness, luxury, or energy. Align your fragrance strategy with the event theme for example, lavender for wellness events or citrus scents for energizing environments. 4. Enliven the Atmosphere with Sound\"The right sound sets the right mood.\"From playlists to ambient noise to human chatter, sound shapes the entire event experience. Choose music that fits the theme, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound design for product reveals. Every sound element should contribute to the overall sensory experience. 5. Activate Touch\"Tactile experiences create lasting impressions.\"Touch adds a tangible dimension to your brand. Use textured materials in decor, offer hands-on product demos, or provide custom-designed giveaways. DIY or workshop zones are also effective, encouraging attendees to engage physically and emotionally with your brand. 6. Tap into Emotion\"When the heart feels, the brand stays.\"Emotional engagement transforms experiences. Encourage attendees to share personal stories, use uplifting or inspiring content, or tell your brand s story through short films. Emotionally charged moments pride, joy, inspiration convert passive guests into brand advocates. 7. Add Meaning Through Spirit\"Brands with purpose make a deeper impact.\" True impact comes when experiences reflect the brand s deeper values and mission. Include social impact initiatives, tie into environmental or cultural causes, or create space for guests to share dreams and beliefs. Let every moment mean more than just fun make it meaningful.Case Study: Brands That Successfully Used Sensory Experience to Win Over AudiencesIncorporating the sensory experience model in event planning doesn t just create fleeting impressions. It can shift consumer behavior, boost conversions, and build lasting brand recognition. Here are two success stories that prove its effectiveness:Traveloka: Engaging Travelers with Limited SpaceAs the travel industry began recovering post-COVID-19, regional platform Traveloka sought to reignite interest among travelers.

One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through Single Customer View (SCV) a unified approach that consolidates customer data from all touchpoints into one comprehensive profile. With a complete view of each customer, brands can deliver more personalized, consistent, and meaningful experiences across channels.What Is Single Customer View (SCV)?SCV stands for Single Customer View, which refers to the process of aggregating customer data from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, social media, email, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and customer service teams and integrating it into a centralized system.When all data points are connected, businesses gain a 360-degree perspective of each customer s behaviors, preferences, and interactions. This holistic view enables more informed decision-making, precise targeting, and tailored marketing strategies. Benefits of Single Customer ViewImplementing an effective SCV can transform how your brand interacts with customers. Below are the top benefits of Single Customer View for modern businesses:Enhance Personalization EffortsUp-to-date, comprehensive customer data allows brands to craft more relevant messages, offers, and campaigns. This reduces the feeling of being \"sold to\" and increases the likelihood of conversions.Improve Omnichannel Customer ExperiencesBy unifying data across all platforms, customers receive seamless and consistent service, no matter which channel they use to engage with your brand.Increase Accuracy in Data Analysis and ForecastingWith clean, centralized data, analysts can more clearly identify customer behavior patterns and emerging trends. This results in more accurate forecasting and better-informed strategic decisions.Reduce Costs and Operational InefficienciesSCV helps eliminate duplicate or fragmented data, enabling sales, marketing, and customer service teams to operate more efficiently saving time, reducing errors, and cutting unnecessary costs.How to Create a Single Customer ViewWhile the concept of SCV may sound straightforward, building a complete and effective customer view requires the right tools, technologies, and strategic planning. Here's how to create a Single Customer View in your organization:1. Connect Data Across Platforms for a Clear Customer PictureCreating an SCV begins with collecting data from every customer touchpoint website, mobile apps, social media channels, email systems, CRM platforms, and in-store POS systems. Though dispersed across different platforms, each data point provides valuable insights into customer behavior.By accurately linking these data sets, brands can visualize the customer journey in real time and respond with tailored personalization. Tools like Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) and APIs can also streamline the integration process, ensuring all data is funneled into a single, centralized system without duplication or loss.2. Standardize and Cleanse DataOnce data is collected, the next challenge lies in harmonizing various formats and ensuring completeness. Different systems often record data inconsistently mismatched name spellings, duplicate emails, or missing details.Key steps in this phase include:Data Cleansing: Removing errors and duplicates.Data Standardization: Unifying formats (e.g., dates, geographic details).Data Deduplication: Merging repeated records into one accurate entry.Without these processes, the data cannot be effectively analyzed or used to build reliable customer profiles.3. Build 360-Degree Customer ProfilesAfter cleansing and standardizing your data, the next step is to create a 360-degree customer profile. These profiles consolidate demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), behavioral data (e.g., site visits, purchase history), and customer interactions (e.g., chat history, support tickets) into one cohesive view.These comprehensive profiles not only empower marketing teams to personalize campaigns more effectively but also enable seamless collaboration across departments from sales and customer service to product development.4. Use Data to Drive Strategy and Customer EngagementWith well-organized data at your fingertips, your business can now refine its strategic efforts. SCV plays a crucial role in:Personalization: Using real customer insights to deliver relevant content, offers, and communications across the right channels.Customer Journey Mapping: Identifying where each customer is in the buying process to deliver timely, tailored content.Marketing Automation: Automatically triggering personalized campaigns at optimal times to enhance the customer experience. A Single Customer View is more than just a data management strategy it s a powerful tool that allows businesses to understand and connect with their customers on a deeper level. By integrating and analyzing data from all touchpoints, companies can sharpen their marketing and sales strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver exceptional customer experiences.In 2025 and beyond, brands looking to thrive in a competitive digital landscape must invest in building an SCV framework. Whether through in-house data architecture or partnerships with a consulting company, establishing a long-term Single Customer View solution is essential for sustainable business growth.",

Urban Development with InnovationTechnologyMotivationADBy:Jenosize.com40What Is a Smart City? Reimagining Thailand s Urban FutureAmid global disruptions from pandemics and climate volatility to rapidly shifting consumer behavior governments around the world are laying the foundation for smart cities that respond to these challenges systematically. Thailand is no exception. The digital transformation of the public sector is no longer optional it s essential to keeping government services relevant and responsive to the evolving needs of modern citizens.The smart city concept is a powerful mechanism that enables Thailand to transition from traditional bureaucracy toward modern, agile, and interconnected governance.What Is a Smart City and Why Does It Matter?A smart city is a model of urban development that integrates data, digital technology, and intelligent systems to manage city resources and services with maximum efficiency, sustainability, and alignment with citizen needs. These services span transportation, energy, public safety, environmental management, healthcare, and education.The core goal of smart cities is not just technological advancement it s about improving the quality of life for citizens, lowering government operating costs, and building a sustainable urban economy. This is achieved through real-time decision-making, resource optimization, and fostering innovations that meet society s evolving demands.Understanding Government Digital Transformation: The Foundation of a Smart CityTrue smart city development cannot occur if public agencies cling to outdated structures and workflows. That s why government digital transformation is the foundational step toward enabling seamless, future-ready governance.Key components of this transformation include:Data Integration: Consolidating data across departments to form a cohesive picture of both the city and its citizens.e-Government: Delivering public services through digital channels that are fast, accessible, and convenient.Big Data & Analytics: Collecting and analyzing large-scale data to enable informed policymaking.Cybersecurity: Ensuring strict data protection standards to build public trust.Public-Private Partnerships: Accelerating the Path to Smart City ImplementationPublic-Private Partnerships (PPP) are widely recognized as a vital driver of sustainable smart city development. Collaborating with private enterprises helps reduce the financial burden on governments while unlocking access to cutting-edge technology and domain expertise. Key initiatives include:Designing user-friendly government services through improved UX UI.Developing citizen-facing CRM systems to manage behavior data and engagement.Creating communication strategies that promote public understanding and service accessibility.Smart City Examples: Global Case Studies of Digital Urban TransformationTo better understand what a smart city looks like in action, here are several smart city examples from around the world that offer valuable insights for Thailand s future:Singapore: A nationwide smart infrastructure system with environmental sensors, traffic tracking, and real-time health services integrated via mobile apps that link the government and citizens.Estonia: A pioneer in e-Government with e-Residency and e-Tax systems that enable citizens to access government services entirely online.Dubai: A global leader in blockchain adoption for public services, reducing redundancy, enhancing transparency, and securing government data.Challenges Facing Thailand s Smart City TransformationDespite Thailand s active efforts to pursue smart city development, several challenges remain:Digital infrastructure is unevenly distributed, especially in remote areas.Government agencies often operate in silos, limiting data integration.Public sector personnel lack digital and data management skills.Public trust in how governments collect and use personal data is still low.The Future of Government in Thailand s Digital AgeTo ensure long-term, sustainable smart city development, Thailand s public sector must prioritize four strategic approaches:1. Design Thinking for Public ServicesBy shifting from a government-centric to a citizen-centric mindset, design thinking emphasizes empathy, user experience, and service simplicity. This approach reduces bureaucratic complexity and promotes inclusive, intuitive service design for all demographics.2. Open Data & TransparencyGovernment transparency starts with open data sharing structured, accessible information that citizens, businesses, and researchers can reuse. Public access to data like budgets, urban plans, and health statistics fuels innovation and strengthens policy accountability. Open data also builds public trust and fosters ongoing feedback that improves service delivery.3. Agile GovernanceMoving away from rigid bureaucratic systems, agile governance allows for flexible, cross-functional collaboration, rapid response to change, and continuous learning. Short-term goal setting and iterative feedback loops make public administration more adaptable and effective.4. SustainabilitySustainability is key to smart city features. Digital public policies must consider environmental impact by incorporating long-term system resilience, clean energy usage, IoT-based waste management, and reduced paper consumption through digital service migration.Smart city development and government digital transformation are not merely technical initiatives they represent a complete shift in governance philosophy, service delivery, and citizen engagement. Building structural readiness, welcoming private sector collaboration, and prioritizing quality of life are all essential to creating truly smart cities and enhancing Thailand s long-term national competitiveness.For public sector organizations ready to take the next step toward becoming a smart city, choosing a business consulting company with expertise in both digital technology and public governance is critical.

From geopolitical tensions and climate change to economic uncertainty and rapid technological advancements, today s global vulnerabilities stem from these intertwined risk factors, creating cascading effects that are impossible to separate.According to the Global Risks Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum (WEF), several risk factors demand urgent attention. This has prompted policymakers and organizations worldwide to take immediate action in preparing for potential threats across multiple dimensions. One effective approach involves leveraging in-depth data analysis and expert insights from digital consulting to develop strategic, proactive risk management solutions.10 Global Risk Factors in 2025 That Organizations Must Prepare For Economic Risks1. Geopolitical Conflicts and TensionsPolitical conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties are major risk factors affecting the global economy. Tensions between major powers such as the United States, China, and Russia could lead to economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and disruptions in global supply chains. Additionally, conflicts in the Middle East and Asia may impact energy prices and financial market stability.Organizations that rely on international markets must plan for these risks by diversifying their resources and business partners while closely monitoring trade policies and protectionist measures.2. Economic Crises and Financial InstabilityWhile many countries have begun recovering from the impacts of COVID-19, the global economy remains fragile. Economic slowdowns in major markets like the U.S. and Europe could have widespread effects across industries. Furthermore, rising interest rates and high levels of public debt continue to create financial uncertainties. Businesses should closely track economic indicators and develop financial strategies such as investment diversification and effective cash flow management to mitigate risks.3. Health Crises and PandemicsAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the risk of new disease outbreaks remains one of significant economic risks. Virus mutations, vaccine hesitancy, and limitations in healthcare systems in certain regions could lead to more uncontrollable outbreaks. Businesses that rely on a stable workforce and supply chains should develop health risk mitigation plans, such as adopting flexible work arrangements and enhancing workplace health and safety measures.4. Labor Shortages and Economic InequalityMany countries are facing labor shortages due to declining birth rates and shifting workforce structures. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) has also replaced certain job roles, potentially leading to unemployment for low-skilled workers. Organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforce while implementing policies that promote economic equality and access to opportunities.5. Shortages of Strategic ResourcesEssential resources for key industries, such as semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and clean energy, are facing supply shortages due to geopolitical and environmental factors. Uncertainties in international trade and geopolitical conflicts could further disrupt supply chains and increase production costs. Businesses must explore alternative resource sources, develop recycling technologies, and enhance domestic production capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.Environmental & Social Risks6. Environmental Disasters and Climate ChangeThe increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, severe storms, and heatwaves are significantly impacting global industries. Rising operational costs, disruptions in supply chains, and damage to infrastructure are becoming major challenges for businesses. Climate change is also driving regulatory shifts, pushing organizations to adopt cleaner energy sources and reduce carbon emissions. Businesses must develop adaptive strategies, including integrating sustainable practices, investing in resilient infrastructure, and optimizing resource efficiency. Furthermore, growing pressure from governments, investors, and consumers regarding ESG compliance is reshaping corporate priorities, making sustainability a critical factor for long-term success.7. Erosion of human rights and civil libertiesThe increasing control over information, media restrictions, and tightening regulations on civil freedoms in various countries pose significant risks to businesses operating in those environments. Policies limiting access to information, imposing strict data regulations, and restricting freedom of expression can affect corporate transparency and hinder international trade. Additionally, human rights concerns such as forced labor, surveillance, and privacy violations can harm an organization s reputation, leading to consumer backlash and legal consequences. Companies must proactively address these risk factors by enforcing robust human rights policies, conducting thorough due diligence in supply chains, and ensuring compliance with ethical business practices to maintain operational stability and stakeholder trust.Technological Risks8. Social Divisions and MisinformationThe spread of misinformation and fake news has far-reaching impacts on both society and business, particularly in an age where social media plays a key role in communication. False information can lead to misunderstandings among consumers, negatively affecting brand reputation and sparking social conflicts. To mitigate these technological risks, businesses must implement effective data governance policies, leveraging AI and Machine Learning to detect false information, while enhancing transparency in their communications with customers and stakeholders.9. Technology and Cyber ThreatsThe advancement of technologies like AI, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing presents business opportunities but also increases cyber security risks. Threats such as ransomware and phishing attacks can lead to data breaches and significant financial damage. Companies need to invest in advanced cybersecurity systems, develop risk management strategies, and prioritize employee training on cyber threat prevention measures to safeguard their operations.10. Negative Impacts of Advanced TechnologyWhile technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation enhance workplace efficiency, they also introduce technological risks such as privacy violations, cyber security issues, and job displacement. Additionally, ethical concerns surrounding AI, such as algorithmic bias or misuse of personal data, may have legal and reputational consequences. Organizations adopting these technologies must focus on ethical development practices, implementing measures to prevent cyber threats, and ensuring personal data protection to minimize potential risks. In order to reduce risk factors and enhance resilience in the face of crises, businesses, government agencies, and the public must collaborate to establish sustainable strategies. Digital consulting services will play a vital role in connecting all stakeholders and assisting organizations in developing strategies that address the challenges of the digital era. This will enable organizations to adapt and develop appropriate solutions to navigate 2025 with greater strength and flexibility.",

Whether it s ChatGPT, Bing Copilot, or Google SGE (Search Generative Experience), these tools present answers that go beyond just listing results from websites. They offer responses that take into account the user's intent and the reliability of the information.In an era where AI plays a central role in information retrieval, adapting to AI Search or \"AI Search Marketing\" has become increasingly important. This process ensures that your brand \"appears\" in the answers that AI presents, enabling you to directly reach customers and increase business growth effectively.What is AI Search Marketing?AI Search Marketing is a marketing strategy focused on ensuring your brand \"appears\" or is featured in the responses AI generates when answering user questions. Unlike traditional search engines that pull information solely from websites or databases, AI can now also retrieve data from various other sources such as forums, social media, and open-source databases. This diversity makes AI responses more comprehensive and varied.Simply put, AI Search Marketing isn t just about providing information on your website; it s about ensuring that your data is selected by AI to be used as an answer one that aligns with the user s intent and presents a suitable solution. How Does AI Search Marketing Differ from SEO?Both SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and AI Search Marketing aim to appear in user search results, but they have clearly different approaches and processes:SEO to Rank on Google: SEO focuses on optimizing a website so that it ranks on traditional search engines like Google. This involves improving content quality and using relevant keywords.AI Search Marketing to Be Selected by AI: In contrast, AI Search Marketing focuses on getting your brand s information selected by AI to be used in its responses. AI pulls from a variety of data sources, such as website content, forum discussions, or social media conversations.Behind the Scenes of AI SearchAI Search Marketing relies on complex processes to synthesize data from multiple sources in order to provide the most accurate and appropriate answers to users. Key steps in this process include:Using Data from Multiple Sources: AI pulls from websites, forums, social media, and open-source databases to create the most relevant answer.User Intent Analysis: AI analyzes the intent behind the user s query whether they are looking for general information, recommendations, or step-by-step guidance (How-to).Answer Synthesis: After gathering information, AI selects and synthesizes the most relevant and accurate response to meet the user s needs. How to Do AI Search Marketing and Ensure Your Brand Appears in AI Responses1. Create In-Depth and Accurate ContentCreating detailed content that thoroughly answers user questions is a core strategy in AI Search Marketing. AI pulls data from multiple sources to process and provide the most precise answers. High-quality content should address all aspects of a question and make it easier for AI to select your data as the answer.For example, if a user asks about choosing an energy-efficient air conditioner, the content should cover factors like capacity, energy usage, installation, maintenance, and performance.2. Focus on Q&A, How-to, or Pain Point ContentContent like Q&A or How-to articles is favored by AI, as it directly answers the user's questions. Addressing pain points (problems or needs) is equally important, as it provides practical solutions that users are looking for, especially when they need help solving a specific issue, such as caring for skin dried out by air conditioning.3. Use Structured Data Schema MarkupStructured Data or Schema Markup organizes information in a way that AI can easily understand. Adding Schema Markup to your website helps AI quickly retrieve and use your data in its responses. For example, if your website contains restaurant information, Schema Markup allows AI to recognize this and use it to answer queries about restaurant locations, menus, and more.4. Boost Brand Credibility (E-E-A-T)A key factor in getting your brand featured in AI search results is building credibility through E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust. AI prioritizes content from brands that demonstrate high E-E-A-T:Experience: The brand's experience in providing services or products.Expertise: The brand s proficiency in its industry.Authoritativeness: The brand s reputation and industry leadership.Trust: The trustworthiness from users or reputable sources.A high E-E-A-T score signals to AI that your content is valuable and reliable, increasing the likelihood of it being featured in AI-generated answers.5. Distribute Information Across Multiple Channels (Omni-channel Footprint)Distributing brand information across various channels increases the likelihood that AI will use your content in its answers. By sharing data through your website, social media, and services like Google My Business, you create a broader presence that AI can pull from, improving the accuracy and relevance of its responses.6. Regularly Update ContentAI tends to favor fresh, up-to-date content. Regularly updating your website ensures your brand's content remains relevant and timely. This could include adding industry updates, addressing frequently asked questions, or correcting errors in older content.Case Study: Brands Successfully Using AI Search MarketingIn recent years, several brands have succeeded by leveraging AI Search Marketing, particularly within digital marketing and SEO sectors. These brands have attracted attention from AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and other AI platforms.1. HubSpotHubSpot provides an all-in-one inbound marketing platform that includes tools for CRM, content creation, and digital campaign management. By creating content that answers user questions on various topics like SEO, digital content creation, and online sales techniques, HubSpot has become a go-to resource for AI when responding to queries about marketing.HubSpot s use of Structured Data makes it easy for AI to access and present their content. Regular updates ensure the information remains relevant to current trends and user needs.2. MozMoz, a well-known brand in the SEO industry, uses AI Search Marketing effectively by providing in-depth content related to SEO tools and strategies. Their content often comes in the form of Q&A, How-to guides, and expert advice, making it easy for AI to feature Moz s resources in search results about SEO. The benefits of AI Search Marketing are vast. It enhances your brand's visibility in AI-powered search engines, directly targets users with high-quality, relevant answers, and improves the chances of increasing engagement and conversions. Brands that align their content strategy with AI search capabilities not only improve their search ranking but also become more relevant to users needs, driving business growth.By quickly adjusting your strategies to work with AI, partnering with a tech agency that specializes in data analysis and digital marketing can ensure your strategies are both effective and up-to-date. This will give you a competitive edge and open up more opportunities to grow and expand your customer base in today s digital world.",
